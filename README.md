# Hello World!
I'm a Front End Developer and a Blockchain Enthusiast from Kenya.

I like to craft solid and scalable front-end products with great user experiences.

My daily routine consists of (but is not limited to):
- drinking coffee, 
- coding, and 
- overcoming boredom ðŸ˜‰.

Interested in working ðŸ’¼ together? Feel free to [reach me](mailto:gitonga.deus@gmail.com).
